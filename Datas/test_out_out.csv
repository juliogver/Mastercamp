Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3.

The camera is excellent and for my usage the battery is sufficient. Better carry a powerbank if youre a heavy user.

Good for photography but excellent for videography* Smooth display. It is only LCD display but far better than android phones LCD displays* Wireless ...READ MORE,positive
5,Hands down the best value for money product in the segment. On one hand we have the best in class A13 bionic processor and on the other hand the best mobile operating system ever. With the privacy features but into iOS 14 it i THE PHONE to own in these times. The camera also never disappoints as it takes amazing pictures without you even thinking about the exposure. Highly recommend it to anyone who doesnt like big bulky phones and need a super fast and secure operating system performance.READ MORE,very positive

3,"Battery life is not very good, but charges very quickly. Gets fully charged in 2 hours. Camera, sound quality, display and performance are excellent as expected of apple products, but heating issues are there. If you're using continuously for a couple hours, the device becomes so hot you can't hold it. The adapter also heats up during charging.Apart from this and short battery life, everything else is satisfactory.READ MORE",neutral

There is no lag in performance, if you shift from Android to iOS then you will feel the roughness in Android and the smoothness in in iOS.

5,Best phone. Camera & overall performance is well. Also if you previously used some big screen mobile then it feels too small.But completely disappointed with battery performance. Mobile heats if you are watching videos on YouTube or some heavy app. Battery drains much fast. Also apple doesnt provides fast charging adapter even after this phone supports fast charging. You have to charge it two or thrice in a day if you are spending more time on mobile. But at the end best budget iphone.READ MORE,very positive

For gaming screen is little bit short but not too short for video watching. If you want an iPhone but budget is low than it is best choice under 30k.READ MORE,positive
